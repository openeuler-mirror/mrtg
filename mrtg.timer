# You can use this unit to periodically run mrtg.service.
# Only enable if you do not want to run mrtg as a daemon.
# Starting mrtg.timer while mrtg.service is running as a daemon has no point.
#
# Please disable /etc/crond.d/mrtg job when using this unit!
#
# Default is to run mrtg.service every 5 minutes, starting
# 1 minute after system boot.
